dmpd:
	name: Distributed MPD
	problem: Multiple machines have distinct music libraries
	project: mpd multiplexer that merges the libraries
	notes:
		- A library is a tree of files.
        - Each leaf in the tree is a track.
        - Node collision is one of 2 cases
			- Equivalent node? Fallback source!
			- Inequivalent node? node-name.lib-name
		- Node equivalence by hash of node content
			- Use a non-crypto composable hash that you can remove/add subhashes quickly

screen/mpc integration:
	- Have the output from 'mpc current' on screen's status line

make daemon
	name:
	problem: During development I don't want to manually invoke build commands anymore
	project: system-level daemon that watches source directories and invokes builds automagically
	notes:
		- Error reporting through 'tail -f /var/log/<name>'
		- Need to worry about different types of build systems
