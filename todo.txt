	name: Distributed MPD
	problem: Multiple machines have distinct music libraries
	project: mpd multiplexer that merges the libraries
	notes:
		- A library is a tree of files.
        - Each leaf in the tree is a track.
        - Node collision is one of 2 cases
			- Equivalent node? Fallback source!
			- Inequivalent node? node-name.lib-name
		- Node equivalence by hash of node content
			- Use a non-crypto composable hash that you can remove/add subhashes quickly
